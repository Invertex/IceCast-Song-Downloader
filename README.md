# Stream-ripper

IceCast Stream Ripper GUI utility, allows you to rip songs from an IceCast stream!

Basically, it extracts MP3 with metadata from an IceCast stream URL. 

You can let it rip every song or define filters if you're only interested in certain Artists or songs.

You can let it run and it will process the stream in the background without having to listen to it, when it finds a match for your filter it will save that song.

(The keyword matching is **ANY** match, not **ALL**. So for example if you put two artist names on different lines, it will only save songs from those artists.)
